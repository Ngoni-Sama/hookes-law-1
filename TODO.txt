Design questions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Screen icons
Robotic arm re-design

Systems screen:
Colors for top and bottom springs (I think it would be better to use same colors as series springs)
Controls are significantly smaller (too small?) than in other screens

Energy screen:
Check box to show/hide the Energy bar graph? If so, specify label and location in control panel.
Check box to show/hide Energy area (triangle) on Force plot? If so, specify label and location in control panel.
With k=100, x=0.001, you'll see F=0. Should it be displayed as "> 0 N"?
With k=100, x=0.001, you'll see E=0. Should it be displayed as "> 0 J"?
Math.round( 0.5 ) -> 1, Math.round( -0.5 ) -> 0. Is this desired behavior?
Force plot: red color-coding to applied force is weak, refers back to the previous 2 screens
Both plots: blue point is color-coded to spring constant slider, association is weak, maybe confusing?
Force plot: Energy value can't be color-coded if it sits inside triangle that represents energy area

Implementation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compensate for headLineWidth in LineArrowNode, so that tip is at precisely at (tipX,tipY)
Compute spring shape as a function of displacement (MV's algorithm?)
Split spring into foreground and background, use vertical gradients
Work on the look of the piece at end of spring(s) that the pincers grab
Parallel system: truss should be a triangle, will need to compensate for width when positioning arm
Constrain text size for i18n
