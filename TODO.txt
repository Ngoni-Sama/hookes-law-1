Design questions

With the number of decimal places displayed, calculations don't work out.
Eg: k = 940, x = 0.001 -> F = 0.94, but display shows F = 1

3 decimal places are not sufficient for x. Eg, for F = 1, changing k shows no change in x.

MD isn't happy with the robotic arm design. Defer further implementation of it until
consensus is reached.

In the Systems screen, do we want to show the 300 tick label (1/2 max) for spring constant range (200,600)?
We went to great pains to do this in the Introduction screen, because some felt that
it was pedagogically important.

Do we really need left alignment of icons in the "Systems" control panel?

Do we really want to synchronize applied force and spring constants between the series and parallel systems?
It causes a slight pause when switching between series and parallel systems.
And it feels weird, perhaps because the 2 systems and their control panels are visually distinct.

Parallel: component spring forces need more decimal places, since Feq = F1 + F2 (eg, 41 = 20.5 + 20.5)

Having spring constant controls side-by-side for parallel system doesn't match the
visual layout (or names) of the springs, so I used a vertical layout to match layout
of the springs.  Is this OK?

Series: max applied force vector overlaps control panel
Parallel: truss should be a triangle, will need to compensate for width when positioning arm

Integrate new robotic arm graphics
Make hook rotate up when displacement is zero and not dragging (and not using Applied Force control?)
Split spring into foreground and background, use vertical gradients
Compute spring shape as a function of displacement (MV's algorithm?)
compensate for headLineWidth in LineArrowNode, so that tip is at (tipX,tipY)
constrain text size for i18n
