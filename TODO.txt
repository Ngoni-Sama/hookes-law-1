Telescoping hook
Prevent range exceptions due to rounding

Design questions:
• Do you like the color-coding of the values? It seems necessary when vectors are very small.
• Values are difficult to see when they pass over some objects. Should we put a translucent white background behind them?
• The design doc requests 2px/N for applied force and spring constant vectors. It’s currently set to 1.75px/N. If you want 2px/N,
  we’ll need to shrink the font considerably in the upper-right control panel.
• Should we change titles based on number of systems selected? Eg, “Spring Constant” vs “Spring Constant 1”. Will changing the label make
  students think that it’s a different system? (It is the same system as in the 2-system configuration.)
• Should we change layout based on number of systems selected? Ie, should the single system be vertically centered? Will changing its position make
  students think that it’s a different system? (It is the same system as in the 2-system configuration.)
• Requirements for the 'number of systems’ radio buttons cannot be met with the standard sun.RadioButtonGroup. Specifically, the selected and
  unselected buttons cannot be different colors; they must be the same color with different opacity. I was not involved in formulating the
  requirements for RadioButtonGroup, so I don’t know what was considered. Can we work within the constraints on RadioButtonGroup?
• Units for applied force and displacement are shown, but units for spring constant are not. Is this a pedagogical problem?
• Multitouch issues: I can't disable controls based on whether other controls are in use.  For example, I current have no way to know that the
  applied force slider is being used, in order to disable dragging of the hook. I suggest that we see how the sim behaves when attempting to
  manipulate all 3 variables simultaneously, before we embark on what will be a difficult project.  I don’t recommend disabling multitouch.
• Disabling part of a slider range is not supported by sun.HSlider. A slider with “0 to small” range disabled, (as shown in the design document) will
  be a custom, nontrivial project. Let’s discuss why/whether this is needed, and seek alternative solutions.
• What should the spring look like?
