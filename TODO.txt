Design questions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General:
Screen icons
Robotic arm re-design
Controls are currently at upper-right. Would they look better vertically centered?
Math.round( 0.5 ) -> 1, Math.round( -0.5 ) -> 0. Is this desired behavior? This is in JavaScript and common code.

Energy screen:
Visibility controls for the graph are getting complicated and confusing.
Labels for the graph radio buttons?
Will the "Energy" check box on Force plot be noticed? Would it work indented under radio button in control panel?
Shouldn't "Energy" check box be labeled "Potential Energy"?

Implementation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compensate for headLineWidth in LineArrowNode, so that tip is at precisely at (tipX,tipY)
Compute spring shape as a function of displacement (MV's algorithm)
Split spring into foreground and background, use vertical gradients
Work on the look of the piece at end of spring(s) that the pincers grab
Parallel system: truss should be a triangle, will need to compensate for width when positioning arm
Constrain text size for i18n
Delete experimental/ subdirectory when done with it.
