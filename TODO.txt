Design questions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Screen icons
Robotic arm re-design (recommended to make the red hinge 25% larger)

Systems screen:
Colors for top and bottom springs (I think it would be better to use same colors as series springs)
Controls are significantly smaller (too small?) than in other screens

Energy screen:
Number of decimal places for energy?
Color coding of the Force and Energy XY plots (why is slope line red? why is point blue like spring constant? should values be color-coded like spring? ...)
Should bar graph be labeled "Potential Energy", vertically along axis?
Any need to be able to hide the Energy bar graph?
With k=100, x=0.001, you'll see F=0. Should it be displayed as "> 0 N"?
With k=100, x=0.001, you'll see E=0. Should it be displayed as "> 0 J"?

Implementation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Non-zero displacement is sometimes shown when force is shown as zero (model bug).
Compensate for headLineWidth in LineArrowNode, so that tip is at precisely at (tipX,tipY)
Compute spring shape as a function of displacement (MV's algorithm?)
Split spring into foreground and background, use vertical gradients
Work on the look of the piece at end of spring(s) that the pincers grab
Parallel system: truss should be a triangle, will need to compensate for width when positioning arm
Constrain text size for i18n
